# React-Native-NewsFeed
This is a mobile application to fetch news from a news repository. Similarly to Facebook, and upon pulling down from the top of newsfeed and release, it will trigger a reloading of newsfeed where the latest articles will be fetched from the repository and displayed to the user.
