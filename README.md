# React-Native-NewsFeed

# Description
This is a mobile application to fetch news from a news repository. Similarly to Facebook, and upon pulling down from the top of newsfeed and release, it will trigger a reloading of newsfeed where the latest articles will be fetched from the repository and displayed to the user.


# Implementation
In order to display news feed in a vertical list with pull to refresh feature, I use RefreshControl within ListView to achieve this.

A Text was added on top of the ListView to display error message regarding to the network issues or api issues.

Date & time of all events will be reformatted to the requested format as shown on sample_screen.jpg .

Unit testing was done using Jest.


# Instructions to run the app on iOS simulator / android device or emulator

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

npm start -- --reset-cache

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup). We also recommend installing Genymotion as your Android emulator. Once you've finished setting up the native build environment, there are two options for making the right copy of `adb` available to Create React Native App:

##### Using Android Studio's `adb`

1. Make sure that you can run adb from your terminal.
2. Open Genymotion and navigate to `Settings -> ADB`. Select “Use custom Android SDK tools” and update with your [Android SDK directory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25176594/android-sdk-location).

##### Using Genymotion's `adb`

1. Find Genymotion’s copy of adb. On macOS for example, this is normally `/Applications/Genymotion.app/Contents/MacOS/tools/`.
2. Add the Genymotion tools directory to your path (instructions for [Mac](http://osxdaily.com/2014/08/14/add-new-path-to-path-command-line/), [Linux](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001647.htm), and [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/)).
3. Make sure that you can run adb from your terminal.


# Instructions to start unit test
#### `npm test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests.
